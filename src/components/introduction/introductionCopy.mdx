We're Teacup Whale, a 2 person indie game studio crafting cozy games in gloomy Portland, Oregon. We want to bring more depth to relationship dynamics in this genre.

We believe every character should have a story, dreams, and a life of their own â€“ making your interactions richly rewarding and deeply immersive. It's okay to escape your day job for life on the farm, but sometimes you just want to escape to a little drama.

It's going take a lot of hard work and quite a bit of magic, but we want to create something that's sometimes warm, sometimes exciting and even a little melancholy.

Sign up for updates and we'll bring you along for the ride!
